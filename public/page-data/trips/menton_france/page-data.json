The medieval Old Town is a meandering network of stone streets that eventually leads to the Basilique Saint-Michel, a magnificent example of baroque architecture. Continue on to the Cemetery which affords a lovely view of the region. Another nice walk is along the beach and the Old Port. Southwest of the Old Port is the Jean-Cocteau Museum, dedicated to the artist who lived in Menton from 1956 to 1958. Another worthwhile museum is the Fine Arts Museum (Mus√©e des Beaux-Arts) located in a 17th-century palace. And don't miss the gardens of Menton; there are a half dozen gardens to explore ranging from exotic species to flowering plants to cactuses.","title1":"By Train","title2":"Getting to Menton","description1":"Menton is on the regional train line that runs from Nice to Ventimiglia.
