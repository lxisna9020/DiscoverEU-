The five villages of Fira, Oia, Imerovigli, Firostefani, and Akrotiri sit atop the caldera and offer spectacular views into the crater created from a 16th-century BC volcanic eruption. What remains is an incredible sight and a magical setting for island hikes, infinity pools, luxury hotels, clifftop wineries, and dreamy sunset dinners. With a land area of 76 square kilometers, Santorini is a little bigger than New York’s island of Manhattan.","title1":null,"title2":null,"description1":"Istoria Hotel is the best beach resort in Santorini. A fantastic luxury hotel steps from Perivolos Beach.","title3":null,"description2":"Santorini beaches are composed of volcanic sand and pebbles, full of rugged charm and often striking landscapes. But they are not at all like the great, white sand beaches Greece is known for. The idyllic best beaches in Greece are located elsewhere.","title4":null,"description3":"However, swimming in the clear blue water of Santorini is wonderfully refreshing. Since the beaches have coarse sand, there’s little dust to cloud the water.Don’t come to Santorini primarily for the beaches – come for the volcano boat tours, incredible views, wine, hikes, nightlife, and great food. Spend time at the beaches if you have extra days here.","title5":null,"description4":"Most of the best Santorini beach hotels are located at Kamari, Perissa, and Perivolos Beaches.","description5":null,"images":[{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"src":"/static/40b60c6f47a9611c219defb034a2c7d4/14b42/Santorini.jpg"}}},{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"src":"/static/a30506723b80db55fffcf945c54fe0a8/1ddd8/Santorini2.png"}}},{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"src":"/static/f5bd85589b56fe1cc3c96008e4163196/ee604/Santorini3.png"}}},{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"src":"/static/13c2b63194adc9abca64b6c7a4c004e6/ee604/Santorini4.png"}}}]}}},
