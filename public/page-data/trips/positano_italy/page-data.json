Josephine (owner) is the nicest lady and we feel like family every time we go there (stayed there 3 times already). . The rooms are cute and all are facing the sea. One of the most spectacular views of the coasts can be seen from this B&B.","title3":"Recommendations for day trips","description2":"Beach and lunch at Da Adolfo (reserve a table for lunch before going). This is probably one of our favourite experiences that we do every time we come here. You have to go to the main dock and wait for a boat with a red fish sign Da Adolfo on top. This boat comes every 30 minutes starting from 10 am to 12:30pm... We usually catch the earlier one and spend the time before lunch on the beach enjoying the sun and swimming.","title4":null,"description3":"Da Adolfo has their own sun beds which you can rent but we choose to hang on the public beach on the left at the very end as you exit the boat. They have really fresh seafood! The mussels and the mozzarella lemon leaf is their specialty!","title5":null,"description4":null,"description5":null,"images":[{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"src":"/static/e8ee50fcf759974bbeb8e9ad108b50db/ee604/Positano2.png"}}},{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"src":"/static/9eedabd9ea200b0ed625d5ba294902ba/ee604/Positano3.png"}}},{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"src":"/static/ac004b72d3a18d27f0687fb411f7737c/ee604/Positano4.png"}}},{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"src":"/static/76077f8af35c4c38d061cf9480213bb2/ee604/Positano5.png"}}}]}}},
